title: Decorator Design Pattern
---

The decorator design pattern is one of the structural pattern originally introduced in the Gang of Four design patterns book.  
>It’s intent is to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a
flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality

Let’s go over this pattern with some code examples. For demonstration, consider the following product repository interface and concrete implementation.

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public interface IProductRepository
{
     Product Get(string code);
     Product Save(Product product);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
     private readonly IDbContext _dbContext;
 
     public ProductRepository(IDbContext dbContext)
     {
         _dbContext = dbContext;
     }

     public Product Get(string code)
     {
         var product = _dbContext
             .Products
             .SingleOrDefault(m => m.Code == code);
 
         return product;
     }
 
     public Product Save(Product product)
     {
         _dbContext.Products.Add(product);
         _dbContext.SaveChanges();
 
         return product;
     }
}
</code></pre>

Nothing too completed there. The product repository has two methods Get(string code) which returns product that matches the code provided from the database. And the Save() method, which saves a product to the database.

Let’s say that you want to add caching to the product repository so that you don’t have to query the product from database every time. There are three ways to achieve this, one of course is to add caching into the body of the Get method.

### Solution 1 – Adding caching to Get(string code) method

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public Product Get(string code)
{
       ObjectCache cache = MemoryCache.Default;
       if (cache.Contains(code))
           return (Product)cache;
 
       var product = _dbContext
           .Products
           .SingleOrDefault(m => m.Code == code);
 
       if (product == null) return null;
 
       //add product to cache and ensure it is removed from the cache after 1 minute.
       var cacheItemPolicy = new CacheItemPolicy();
       cacheItemPolicy.AbsoluteExpiration = new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1));           
       cache.Add(code, product, cacheItemPolicy);
 
       return product;
}
</code></pre>

The above code should not be too difficult to understand. MemoryCache is used to cache the product. First, we check whether the product being requested is cached. If yes, the product is returned else the database is queried and if product exists it is added to the cache.

### What is wrong with this solution.

There are few things wrong with this solution. First, this solution violates the single responsibility principle of SOLID. The product repository has two responsibility. Caching and retrieving products from database. Mixing responsibility reduces meaningful test-ability and creates extra noise in the code.

Further to this, what if the client wants to choose at run-time whether to query product from cache or go to the database? With current implementation this is not possible. We could modify the Product Get(string code) method to take an extra parameter Get(string code, bool queryCached).

But, modifying the get product method could potentially break other clients that use this method. On another note, modifying existing classes violates the Open/closed principle.

>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

So how can we achieve this without violating the Open/closed principle?

### Solution 2 - Sub classing repository

Sub classing is another solution to avoid violating the open/closed principle. We can create CachedProductRepository class and sub-class the ProductRepository class as follows.

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public class CachedProductRepository: ProductRepository
{
      public CachedProductRepository(IDbContext dbContext) : base(dbContext) {}
      public override Product Get(string code)
      {
          ObjectCache cache = MemoryCache.Default;
          if (cache.Contains(code))
              return (Product)cache;

          var product = base.Get(code);
          if (product == null) return null;
 
          //add product to cache and ensure it is removed from the cache after 1 minute.
          var cacheItemPolicy = new CacheItemPolicy();
          cacheItemPolicy.AbsoluteExpiration = new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1));
          cache.Add(code, product, cacheItemPolicy);
 
          return product;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

As seen in code above, we've sub-classed the ProductRepository. By introducing CachedProductRepository we no longer violate the open-closed and single responsibly principles. Now the ProductRepository Get(string code) method has single responsibility, which is to query products from the database and return.

Further to this, the client can now choose which implementation to use at runtime. CachedProductRepository  or ProductRepository. With this solution the client is not tied to cached repository which is the case with solution 1.

However, sub-classing ProductRepository violates another principle.

>Interface segregation principle

The client that uses CachedProductRepository is only interested in querying cached products not saving products. By sub classing, the save method of the ProductRepository is also visible to the client. This goes against the Interface segregation principle.

>Client should not be forced to implement or be aware of methods that it doesn't need.

### Solution 3 - Decorator design pattern

This leads to our final solution. Adding caching to ProductRepository using decorate design pattern. This solution is similar to second solution. Instead of sub classing the Product repository, it depends on it via constructor injection.

IProductRepositoryCacheDecorator.cs

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public interface IProductRepositoryCacheDecorator
{
     Product Get(string code);
}
</code></pre>
The concrete implementation

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
public class ProductRepositoryCacheDecorator : IProductRepositoryCacheDecorator
{
     private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;
     public ProductRepositoryCacheDecorator(IProductRepository productRepository)
     {
         _productRepository = productRepository;
     }
 
     public Product Get(string code)
     {
         ObjectCache cache = MemoryCache.Default;
         if (cache.Contains(code))
             return (Product)cache;
 
         var product = _productRepository.Get(code);
         if (product == null) return null;
 
         //add product to cache and ensure it is removed from the cache after 1 minute.
         var cacheItemPolicy = new CacheItemPolicy();
         cacheItemPolicy.AbsoluteExpiration = new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1));
         cache.Add(code, product, cacheItemPolicy);
 
         return product;
     }
}
</code></pre>

As seen in code above, this solution is quite similar to the sub classing solution. The only difference is the constructor injection that is used to depend on the ProductRepository. With this solution, we no longer expose the save method to the client. The client can directly use IProductRepositoryCacheDecorator interface.

One final improvement that could be made is with the static MemoryCache. We can hide this static implementation behind another interface such IMemoryCache. This will make the code more cleaner and easier to test.

## Decorator Design Pattern

The decorator design pattern is one of the structural pattern originally introduced in the Gang of Four design patterns book.

>Itâ€™s intent is to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a
flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality


```c#
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
